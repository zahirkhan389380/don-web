                    <h3>LADAKH FOOD DONATION,</h3>
                    <p>Our mission is to bridge the gap between abundance and need by redistributing surplus food from hotels<br> 
                        to those who need it most in Ladakh. Many hotels often have leftover food that is still perfectly good to eat. Instead of letting<br> 
                        this food go to waste, we collect and distribute it to local communities, ensuring that nutritious meals reach those<br> 
                        who are struggling with food insecurity. Through this initiative, we aim to support the health and well-being of our fellow residents while also promoting sustainability<br> 
                        and reducing waste. Join us in making a difference, one meal at a time.</p>
